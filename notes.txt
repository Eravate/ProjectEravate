Hello World! I doubt anyone will ever read this but just in case, here it goes.

5 months into development I decided to create a small txt file for myself so I can detail 
the brainstorms I've been doing these past few hours, maybe make it into a bigger thing?
I say 5 month development when in reality I have only programmed for like 10 days by now,
after losing my job I couldn't get myself to do anything for 3 months, I've had a lot of
issues at home and development has been very hard, I haven't touched code for so long that
I basically forgot almost all the basics!

You know, sometimes I just can't help but think, maybe I'm just not made for this? maybe
I was right all along, after all, there are so many others that are much better at this,
even in my own classroom, I can't compare myself to the top 3, let alone to the top 1,
during my first year I believed I could actually make a career out of this, that it's
something that I'm finally good at, but during the second year, seeing everyone just
exceed me by far when it came to knowledge, it made me realize that this is just not my
future, but if this isn't my future, what is? maybe I'm not destined for anything? that's 
what I keep telling myself... I should probably go to sleep already.

I can't guarantee I will finish this on time, or maybe at all, some days I really just
want all of this to end, but I haven't been raised to give up this easily, but 1 month to
finish this project? this is going to be the biggest challenge I've taken since I've been
born! Anyways, enough of this little ramble, I really need to get going or else I'll never
finish this, so, as I said, this TXT will contain all of the brainstorming and everything
I couldn't include in the documentation.

Also, why is it that when I have a concept in mind and look at it, I think "yeah, this'll 
be easy to pull off" but then nothing looks like the original concept at all? maybe I should
really switch industries...

Looking at this webpage, 3 months I've really been thinking about implementing the log-in
and the main into one page so that I can transition between them completely, and as of 
now, I've come up with a basic plan.

It will consist on two page loaders in one, earlier concepts had 3, but I think with two 
it will be much easier.

A note will be passed between PHP and jQuery to notify the script whether the user is 
logged in to make sure the right page is loaded.

The first page loader will contain the transition, and will be invisible as of default.

The second page loader will contain both the log-in and the main page, and the first page
loader will be used to make sure the client doesn't see the switch, all of this on one 
page!

I sound enthusiastic but this is the first time I will be doing something like this, but 
it's all trial and error right? I really hope it is, for now I can't help but feel anxious...

The design is another part... I have changed it so many times I can't count it on my own
fingers, and I still don't know which way to go... maybe I should just prepare something
and then switch between styles to decide the final one?

This project has been far more difficult than I expected it to, I already know it won't end 
like I wanted it to, and I won't use this as a portfolio, I don't even think I want to 
finish it.

Well, this will be it for the first day! I have less than 30 days to finish this...

I am extremely close to having a mental breakdown by now, it's not because of the project,
but because of what's happening the last few days in my home, I mean, who would've guessed
living with alcoholic and manipulative parents would've been this hard, right?

It's an extremely hard feeling to describe, it's like you are about to burst into tears for 
no reason at all, if my mental health keeps decreasing like this, I'll be better off in a 
mental asylum.

I barely got anything done today, and I had to take a drive with my car, but the few minutes
I got to drive it into the sunset, the few moments where my brain went into auto-pilot and
allowed be to finally escape my thoughts... It's just an amazing feeling, absolutely
outstanding.

Anyways, I hope I can get something done tomorrow, I guess they can't be drinking 3 days
straight right? right???...

Maybe I should create an admin site for the ease of data insertion? It seems like a lot of work
but it could pay off quite well, I should look into this, specially that manual data insertion
is hell.

This day was extremely tiring, I just can't help but fall asleep every 30 minutes or so, and the
fact that I have one of the most boring jobs to do rn doesn't help at all, like filling out the
database? Eh, It is what It is.

Slow progression is progression at least, but there needs to be a way to pick up the pace in this
system.
